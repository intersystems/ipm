# InterSystems Package Manager - IPM

Helps to install ObjectScript classes and routines, globals, Embedded Python modules, CSP and Frontend packages, and any files into InterSystems IRIS published on the official [Registry](https://pm.community.intersystems.com/packages/-/all) or private registry of your own.

## Compatibility Note
With the release of IPM v0.9.0 on Dec 2024, IPM is no longer mapped across namespaces. 
This is an intentional change so that users can have different IPM versions and configurations in different namespaces. 
If you install IPM on an instance without the legacy 0.7.x version, IPM is only installed to the current namespace.

* To retain the old behavior where %IPM routines and classes mapped across all namespaces, run `zpm "enable -map -globally`. This is automatically performed when upgrading from a legacy version and can be undone by running `zpm "unmap -globally"`.
* You can optionally choose to map IPM repositories across namespaces with `zpm "enable -map -repos -namespaces NS1,NS2,NS3` or `zpm "enable -map -repos -globally`. Repositories are only mapped if %IPM classes and routines are also mapped from the same namespace.
* As a convenience command, `zpm "enable -community"` will make IPM behave essentially the same as legacy versions (v0.7.x) by setting up the the community registry and maping %IPM routines and classes, as well IPM repository settings to all namespaces. 

## Installing ObjectScript Package Manager Client:

0. Use one-liner in terminal call or programmatically:
```
s version="latest" s r=##class(%Net.HttpRequest).%New(),r.Server="pm.community.intersystems.com",r.SSLConfiguration="ISC.FeatureTracker.SSL.Config" d r.Get("/packages/zpm/"_version_"/installer"),$system.OBJ.LoadStream(r.HttpResponse.Data,"c")
```
**If you want the legacy behavior of mapping IPM classes, routines, and repository settings to all namespaces, run `zpm "enable -community"` after installing IPM. See `zpm "help enable"` for details.**
**In a CI script, for deterministic behavior, you should replace version="latest" with the IPM version you wish to use.**

OR:

1. Download the  [latest version](https://pm.community.intersystems.com/packages/zpm/latest/installer) of zpm from the registry
2. Import the zpm.xml into IRIS and compile via any desired way (Management Portal, Studio or Terminal)
 
 After that you can use PackageManager to install modules from [community repository](https://pm.community.intersystems.com) in any namespace.

3. Check if you call a zpm in command line and get the following:
USER>zpm

zpm: USER>
 
## How to Install a ZPM Module:

1. Call this command to open zpm shell:
> USER> zpm  

2. See the list of available modules:
> zpm: USER>repo -list-modules -n registry
>  
> deepseebuttons 0.1.7
> dsw 2.1.35
> holefoods 0.1.0
> isc-dev 1.2.0
> mdx2json 2.2.0
> objectscript 1.0.0
> pivotsubscriptions 0.0.3
> restforms 1.6.1
> thirdpartychartportlets 0.0.1
> webterminal 4.8.3
> zpm 0.0.7

3. You can load any module that resides in any of the definedÂ repos into IRIS. E.g. here is the way to install webterminal:
> zpm: USER> install webterminal  

## To uninstall a module:
> USER> zpm  
>
> zpm: USER> uninstall webterminal
