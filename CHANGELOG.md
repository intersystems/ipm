## [Unreleased - 0.9.0+snapshot]

### Added
- #364 Added ability to restrict the installation to IRIS or IRIS for Health platform to the SystemRequirements attribute
- #518 Added ability to show source file location when running `list-installed`. E.g., `zpm "list-installed -showsource"`.
- #474 Added compatibility to load ".tar.gz" archives in addition to ".tgz"
- #469 Added ability to include an `IPMVersion` in `SystemRequirement` of module.xml
- #530 Added a `CustomPhase` attribute to `<Invoke>` that doesn't require a corresponding %method in lifecycle class.
- #578 Added functionality to record and display zpm history of install, uninstall, and load
- #582 Added functionality to optionally see time of last update and server version of each package
- #609 Added support for `-export-deps` when running the "Package" phase of lifecycle
- #541 Added support for ORAS repository

### Changed
- IPM is now namespace-specific rather than being installed in %SYS and being available instance-wide.
- HSIEO-9484: Add additional argument to buildDepsGraph to allow putting in an additional list element of dependency's DisplayName
- HSIEO-9484: Add additional property DisplayName to %IPM.Storage.ModuleReference
- HSIEO-10274: Separate DependencyAnalyzer out from IPM
- #261: IPM now truly supports using multiple registries for installation / discovery of packages (without needing to prefix the package with the registry name on "install", although it is still possible and now effective to use the prefix).
- #454: IPM 0.9.x+ uses different globals for storage vs. 0.7.0 and previous. Installation will automatically migrate data from the old globals to the new ones. The old globals are left around in case the user decides to revert to an earlier version.

### Fixed

- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9402: % percent perforce directories are no longer necessary

- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9404: Repo check should happen in the order to repo creation, not by repo name
- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9366: Make sure VersionInfo uses exact database namespace instead
- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9384: %IPM.Utils.Build:CreateNamespace should not call %IPM class from %SYS namespace
- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9333: OnDetermineResourceDeployability should make sure to check uppercase of item suffix
- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9315: HSCC needs to re-create %IPM mapping for application namespace because of its mapping deletion
- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9276: Fix dependency analyzer issue
- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9275: IsAvailable() method need to work robustly
- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9277, HSIEO-9235: Remove exportDeployedItem temporarily until HSIEO-9235
- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9278: Mark based module as non deployed if install in dev mode
- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9279: Enable resource mapping creation during build
- HSIEO-9269, HSIEO-9280: Load unittest code during module install
- HSIEO-9430: Module definition should not expose DisplayName + deprecate DisplayNameInternal as it will not be used anymore
- HSIEO-9924: RunDev needs to do complete installation of component and dependencies via ignoreInstalled, so adding ignoreInstalledModules checker in syncLoadDependencies

- #373: Cleaner cross-version approach used in language extension routine generation
- #459: zpm "version" behaves better without internet access
- #224: When updating zpm, existing configuration won't be reset
- #482: Reenabled deployed code support without impact on embedded source control (reworks HSIEO-9277)
- #487: When loading a package, relative paths staring with prefix "http" won't be mistaken for git repo
- #474: When loading a .tgz/.tar.gz package, automatically locate the top-most module.xml in case there is nested directory structure (e.g., GitHub releases)
